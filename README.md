This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error that occurs when passing an argument of the wrong type to a function. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version. The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected argument type and the type of the argument passed.  Understanding type safety is crucial in TypeScript to avoid runtime errors.
